# Tab-Spam
A simple program that opens Chrome, then spams it with new tabs. Change the timeout in the batch file to higher if Chrome loads slower on your computer, and lower it if it loads faster. Change the loop constraint in the VBScript file to change how many tabs are spammed once Chrome is loaded.
